I’m currently a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), under the research guidance of [Prof. Roy Ka-Wei Lee](https://info.roylee.sg/).  I am honoured to receive several prestigious scholarships/awards, including Presidential Doctoral Fellowship Scholarship and the Singapore Data Science Consortium (SDSC) Dissertation Research Fellowship 2024, that support my PhD studies.

My research focus on Computational Social Science with Explainable AI, particularly focusing on explainable approaches for hateful content moderation.
