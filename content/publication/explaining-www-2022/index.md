abstract: Hateful meme detection is a new multimodal task that has gained
  significant traction in academic and industry research communities. Recently,
  researchers have applied pre-trained visual-linguistic models to perform the
  multimodal classification task, and some of these solutions have yielded
  promising results. However, what these visual-linguistic models learn for the
  hateful meme classification task remains unclear. For instance, it is unclear
  if these models are able to capture the derogatory or slurs references in
  multimodality (i.e., image and text) of the hateful memes. To fill this
  research gap, this paper propose three research questions to improve our
  understanding of these visual-linguistic models performing the hateful meme
  classification task. We found that the image modality contributes more to the
  hateful meme classification task, and the visual-linguistic models are able to
  perform visual-text slurs grounding to a certain extent. Our error analysis
  also shows that the visual-linguistic models have acquired biases, which
  resulted in false-positive predictions.
